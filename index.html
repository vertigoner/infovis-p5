                For this project, we chose to visualize the candy dataset in order to aggregate people’s opinions, to compare candy popularity and to determine if certain demographics like age and gender suggest a person’s candy preferences. We decided to use an analytic approach in terms of displaying the data. The dataset was synthesized from the results of a 2017 survey circulated by David Ng and the University of British Columbia (<a href="http://www.scq.ubc.ca/so-much-candy-data-seriously/">see here</a>). Participants were asked a few demographic questions, and were presented with 48 candies, with the options of choosing “Joy”, “Meh”, or “Despair” for each entry.
